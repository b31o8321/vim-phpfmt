Inspired by vim-php-cs-fixer. This plugin integrates php.tools.

This plugin will execute the fmt.phar command on the directory or file (depends on which command you call). See options to know how to customize that.

The plugin comes with php.tools fmt.phar embedded, it should suffice.

If you see any improvement or question, please, contribute or create an issue.
